## Abstract

* **Background** Intraspecific variation exists in a wide range of biological processes and is a key source of species adaptation to environmental changes. Intraspecific variation in the thermal thresholds for germination is widespread in seed plants and has been extensively studied. However, much less is known about intraspecific variation in water thresholds for seed germination. Although the extent and scale of intraspecific variation in the germination base water potential (ψb, i.e., the minimum amount of water required for germination) could have ecological significance in water-limited ecosystems, this effect has never been tested at microclimatic scales.     
* **Methods** We tested the hypothesis that water thresholds for seed germination exhibit functional intraspecific variation along local microclimatic gradients in water-limited Mediterranean alpine ecosystems of the Iberian Peninsula (SW Europe). We sampled 18 subpopulations of Dianthus langeanus (Caryophyllaceae), separated by 10-meter intervals, and with contrasting field-measured microclimatic conditions. We measured germination responses to water stress using polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions, and fitted hydro-time models to calculate the germination ψb of each subpopulation, and to test the expectation that seeds collected from warmer and drier subpopulations had lower ψb (i.e. their germination was more drought-tolerant).

* **Key Results** We found significant differences between subpopulations' ψb indicating intraspecific variation in germination responses to water stress. Seeds from warmer and drier subpopulations had lower ψb, meaning their germination was more drought-tolerant. These results suggest that intraspecific variation in ψb for germination potentially has functional significance at environmental microscales (around 10 meters).

* **Synthesis** Our results indicate that the germination base water potential is a trait with potential implications for individual phenology, reproduction, and fitness in water-limited ecosystems. This functional intraspecific variation in base water potential highlights the adaptative potential of seed germination to both current and future climate scenarios.
